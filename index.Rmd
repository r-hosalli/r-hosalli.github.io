Hi, I'm currently a second-year graduate student pursuing an MPH in Epidemiology at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in NYC. My interests are global health, HIV/AIDS and cardiovascular disease epidemiology. On this site you'll find an overview of my academic and professional background, as well as dashboard and links to my github page and email.
