Hi, I'm currently a second-year graduate student pursuing an MPH in Epidemiology at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in NYC. My interests are global health, HIV/AIDS and cardiovascular disease epidemiology. On this site you'll find an overview of my academic and professional background, as well as a dashboard from NOAA NY data and links to my github page, email and Linkedin.

In my free time I like to travel, cook and go bouldering. I've recently gotten into fermentation: I've made lactofermented hot sauce, pickles and sourdough bread.
